                                    String
                                    ------

    1. String 
    -> String are used to store text.
    -> A string variable contains of characters surrounded by doubles quotes.

    2. Concatenation
    -> The + operator can be used between strings to add them together to make a new string.
    -> This is called Concatenation.
    -> Example:- string firstName = "Rahul";
                 string lastName = "Shirke";
                 string fullName = firstName + lastName;
                 cout << fullName;

    3. Append
    -> A string in C++ is an object, Which contains functions that can perform certain operations
       on string.
    -> For example, you can also Concatenation string were the append() functions:
                    tring firstName = "Rahul";
                    string lastName = "Shirke";
                    string fullName = firstName.append(lastName);
                    cout << fullName;
   
   4. String Length
   -> To get lenght of a string, use the lenght() functions.
   -> string txt = "It's my first time to vote";
      cout << " The lenght = " << txt.length();

   -> You might have seen c++ programs that use the size() function to get the lenght of
       a String.
   -> This is a just an alias of length().

   5. Acess String 
   -> You can access the characters in a string by refferring to its index number inside square brakets[].
   -> Example :- string myString = "hello";
                 cout << myString [0];
                 myString[1] = 'E';
                 cout << myString;

   6. User Input String
   -> It is possible to use the extraction operation >> on cin to stored a string entered by a user.
   -> However, cin considers a space(Whitespace, tabs, etc) as a terminating charector which means
      that it can only store a single world.
   -> We often use the getline() function to read a line of text. 

       getline(cin , string );

   -> Example:- 1.string firstName;
                  cout << "Enter your first name:";
                  getline(cin, firstName);
                  cout << firstName;

                  // Instead firstname name it fullName.
